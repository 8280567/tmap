# **geo** in a nutshell

### Introduction

With the geo package, statistical thematic maps can be generated with great flexability. The syntax for creating plots is very similar to `ggplot2`. It also contains functions to deal with shape objecte, where many are convenient wrappers of functions from other packages such as `sp` and `rgeos`.


### Shape objects

We refer to **shape objects** as objects from the class `Spatial` from the package `sp`. The six supported subclasses are:

|   	| Without data	| With data   	|
|---	|---	|---	|
|Polygons   	| SpatialPolygons  	| SpatialPolygonsDataFrame  	|
|Points   	| SpatialPoints  	| SpatialPointsDataFrame  	|
|Lines   	| SpatialLines  	| SpatialLinesDataFrame  	|

Obviously, shape objects with data (the right-hand side column) are recommended, since data is what we want to show.

Load shape object of Europe (contained in this package):
```{r}
data(Europe)
```

Shape objects in ESRI format can be read with `read_shape` and saved with `write_shape`.

Projection can be get and set with `get_projection` and `set_projection` respectively.


### Quick plot

The `geo` function is `geo`'s equivalent to `ggplot2`'s `qplot`. The first, and only required argument is a shape object.

```{r}
geo(Europe)
```

A choropleth is created with one line of code:

```{r}
geo(Europe, fill="gdp_cap_est", text="iso_a3", text.cex="pop_est", title="GDP per capita", textNA="Non-European countries")
```

The function geo offers the same flexibility as the main plotting method (see below). However, it only supports one shape object.

### Plotting with geo elements

The main plotting method, the equivalent to `ggplot2`'s `ggplot`, consists of elements that start with `geo_`. Start with `geo_shape` that specifies the shape object. Next, one, or a combination of the following drawing layers should be specified:

|Drawing layer	| Main arguments	|
|---	|---	|
|geo_fill   	| col<sup>2</sup>  	|
|geo_borders   	| col<sup>1</sup>, lwd<sup>1</sup>  	|
|geo_bubbles   	| size<sup>2</sup>, col<sup>2</sup>  	|
|geo_lines		| col<sup>2</sup>, lwd<sup>2</sup>		|
|geo_text   	| text<sup>3</sup>, cex<sup>4</sup>  	|

where the numbers mean the following:

1. Only constant values can be assigned to these arguments. For instance `geo_borders(col="gray50", lwd=2)`.
2. These arguments can be used in two ways:
   + To assign fixed, constant values. For instance `geo_fill(col="blue")`.
   + To assign a data variable. For instance `geo_fill(col="var1")`, where `"var1"` is the name of a data variable in the shape object. This variable can be numerical, and in case of a color attribute, also categorical (i.e., `factor`). These 5 arguments are currently the only statistical attributes for which also a legend is generated.
3. The text attribute of `geo_text` should be the name of a data variable.
4. The cex attribute of `geo_text` can be used for a constant value and a statistical variable (like number 2), but no legend is generated.

The last plot is reproduced as follows:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
geo_shape(Europe) +
	geo_fill("gdp_cap_est", textNA="Non-European countries") +
	geo_borders() +
	geo_text("iso_a3", cex="pop_est") + 
geo_theme("GDP per capita")
```

We call `geo_shape` plus the drawing layers (all of the elements in the last example except `geo_theme`) a **group**. Multiple groups can be stacked. To illustrate this, let's create a simple topographic map of Europe:

```{r, fig.width=10}
data(rivers)
data(cities)

geo_shape(Europe) +
	geo_fill("pop_est_dens", style="kmeans", textNA="Non-European countries") +
	geo_borders() +
geo_shape(rivers) +
	geo_lines("dodgerblue3") +
geo_shape(cities) +
	geo_text("name", cex="pop_max", scale=1, ymod=-.02, root=4, cex.lowerbound = .60, bg.color="yellow", bg.alpha = 150) + 
	geo_bubbles("pop_max", "red", border.col = "black", border.lwd=1, size.lim = c(0, 2e7)) +
geo_shape(Europe) +
	geo_text("name", cex="area", scale=1.5, root=8, cex.lowerbound = .40, fontface="bold", case=NA, fontcolor = "gray35") + 
geo_theme_Europe("Map of Europe", legend.titles = c(fill="Country population density (people per km2)", bubble.size="City Population"))
```

Thinks to learn from this code:

* This plot has 4 groups of layers, respectively from the shape objects Europe, rivers, cities, and again Europe. 
The order of (groups of) layers corresponds to the plotting order.
* The shape objects can have different projections, and can also cover different areas (bounding boxes). Both the projection and the covered area are taken from the first layer shape object. The plot `geo_shape(rivers) + geo_lines("dodgerblue3")` will show the rivers around the world in latitute longitude coordinates.
* The element `geo_theme` controls all layout options such as fonts, legends, and margins. The element `geo_theme_Europe` is identical with other defaults that are tailored for Europe: the left inner margin is increased to make space for the legend.



### Small multiples

Small multiples are generated in two ways:

1. By assigning multiple values to at least one of the 5 main arguments (in the table above indicated by the number 2)
```{r, fig.width=10, fig.height=3}
geo_shape(Europe) +
	geo_fill(c("pop_est_dens", "gdp_cap_est"), style="kmeans") +
geo_theme_Europe(scale=2, title = c("Population density", "GDP per capita"))
```

2 By defining a group by variable in `geo_facets`:
```{r, fig.width=10}
geo_shape(Europe) +
	geo_fill("gdp_cap_est", style="kmeans") +
	geo_facets("part") +
geo_theme_Europe(scale=4, legend.titles = c(fill="GDP per capita"))
```


### Tips n' tricks

1. Selections can be made by treating the data.frame of the shape object:
```{r, fig.height=4}
geo_shape(Europe[Europe$name=="Austria", ]) +
	geo_fill()
```

2. A one-item legend can be generated by using a categorical data variable with a one category, and assigning a single color value to palette:
```{r, fig.height=3}
rivers$constant <- factor("Rivers")
geo_shape(rivers) +
	geo_lines(col="constant", palette="dodgerblue3") +
	geo_theme_World("World map")
```

3. Each drawing element has a scalar arguemnt called `scale`. The overall scaling and font sizes can be set by the `scale` argument in `geo_theme`.
