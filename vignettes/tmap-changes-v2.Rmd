This vignette summarizes the main changes in tmap 2.0 in comparison to tmap 1.11-2, which is described in detail in

Tennekes, M., 2018, {tmap}: Thematic Maps in {R}, Journal of Statistical Software, 84(6), 1-39, https://doi.org/10.18637/jss.v084.i06

### Function renaming: tm_ and tmap_

As of version 2.0, all tmap functions have the prefix `tm_` or `tmap_`, with the exception of the function `qtm`. Just like in tmap version 1.x, the layer functions start with `tm_`. In tmap 1.x, the names of the other functions where inconsistent, e.g. `animation_tmap` and `tmap_arrange`. In tmap 2.0, these functions are prefixed with `tmap_`. For instance `animation_tmap` has been renamed to `tmap_animation`.

### sf

Recently, the `sf` package has replaced `sp` as the leading package for processing for vectorized geospatial data. Although tmap 1.x already supported `sf` objects, it was build upon `sp`.

tmap version 2.0 is fully build on `sf`. For raster objects, it still uses `raster`.

An `sf` object (which stands for simple features) has a less complex structure than `sp` objects. An `sf` object is nothing more than a `data.frame` with a special geometry column, which contains the geometries for the corresponding rows. Such a geometry can be spatial point(s), line(s), polygon(s), or any combination. The layers functions, such as `tm_polygons`, will only draw what they are supposed to draw (in this case polygons). The newly added layer function `tm_sf` will draw all geometries.

Finally, all data objects in `tmap` (except `land`) have been transformed to `sf` objects.


### tm_tiles

Tile layers can now be added, not only as basemaps. There are two new layer functions: `tm_basemap` and `tm_tiles`. The former creates a basemap tile and the latter an overlay tile, which is especially useful for semi-transparent layers.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
data(World, metro)
tmap_mode("view")

tm_basemap(leaflet::providers$CartoDB.PositronNoLabels, group = "CartoDB basemap") +
tm_shape(World) +
	tm_polygons("HPI", group = "Countries") +
tm_tiles(leaflet::providers$CartoDB.PositronOnlyLabels, group = "CartoDB labels") +
tm_shape(metro) +
	tm_dots(col = "red", group = "Metropolitan areas")
```

You can play with the interactive version by running the code above." onload="$(this).tooltip()">

### tmap options, styles, and formats

There are many options in tmap. In version 1.x, the default values where stored in `tm_layout` and `tm_view`. Wrapper functions like `tm_style_gray` and `tm_format_World` where used to change these options.

In version 2.0, the options are stored in a similar fashion as the global options. Which the function `tmap_options` a list can be retrieved with tmap options, or options can be set. Its bevahior is similar to the function `options`.

A style is a configuration of the options used to style the maps in a specific way. When set with `tmap_style`, the current options are overwritten according to the new style. The changes can be seen with `tmap_options_diff` and can be reset with `tmap_options_reset`.

```{r, fig.height=3}
data(World)
qtm(World, fill = "life_exp")

tmap_style("classic")

qtm(World, fill = "life_exp")

tmap_options_diff()

tmap_options_reset()
```

Styles included in tmap are: `"white"`, `"gray"`, `"natural"`, `"cobalt"`, `"col_blind"`, `"albatross"`, `"beaver"`, `"bw"`, `"classic"`. New styles can saved and loaded with `tmap_style_save` and `tmap_style_load` respectively.  

In version 1.x, `tmap` contained a couple of predefined format functions, such as `tm_format_World`. In verion 2.0, these have been replaced by the general function `tm_format`. With this function, the available formats can be retrieved, as well as the configuration of a specific format. With the function `tm_format_add` new formats can be created.

```{r}
tmap_format()
panorama <- tmap_format("World")
panorama$asp <- 6
tmap_format_add(panorama, name = "panorama")
tmap_format()
```

Unlike a style, a format cannot be set globally. Instead, it has to be specified in each plot:


```{r, fig.height = 1}
tm_shape(World) + tm_polygons("HPI") + tm_format("panorama")
# or: qtm(World, fill = "HPI", format = "panorama")
```



### filter, difference between NA and NULL

The argument filter has been added to `tm_shape`. Features that are included will be visualized as usual. Excluded features will still be visualized but without mapped color. Instead they will be colored with `colorNULL`, and new argument of the layer functions. Note the difference with `colorNA`, which is used to color features with missing data.

To show the potiential of this filter:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
tm_shape(World, filter= World$continent=="Europe") + tm_polygons("HPI", id = "name")
```

<img src="images/tmap_filter.jpg" alt="sigma" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="right" title="" data-original-title="Note this is just a screenshot of the visualization so it's not interactive. You can play with the interactive version by running the code above." onload="$(this).tooltip()">

Countries outside Europe are colored with `colorNULL`, which is `grey95` by default and can be adjusted in the layer functions, such as `tm_polygons`, and in `tmap_options`.

That that there are also missing values in the data, Kosovo and Moldova, which are colored with the `colorNA`, which is by default `grey85`.
